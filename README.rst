# End of Life Notece

The MongoDB HHVM Driver is now officially end-of-life (EOL). No further development, bugfixes, enhancements, documentation changes or maintenance will be provided by this project and pull requests will no longer be accepted.

About
-----

This is the low-level HHVM driver for MongoDB. The API is the same as the PHP
driver for MongoDB. The documentation for both of them is the same, and can be
found at http://www.php.net/manual/en/set.mongodb.php

The driver is written to be a bare bone layer to talk to MongoDB, and
therefore misses many convenience features. Instead, these convenience methods
have been split out into a layer written in PHP, the `MongoDB Library`_.
Using this library should be your preferred way of interacting with MongoDB.

Please note that the new HHVM and PHP drivers implement a **different API**
from the legacy driver at http://pecl.php.net/package/mongo; therefore
existing libraries that use the legacy driver (e.g. `Doctrine MongoDB's ODM`_)
will not work with the new drivers.

.. _`Doctrine MongoDB's ODM`: http://doctrine-mongodb-odm.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
.. _`MongoDB Library`: http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-php-library/

In the long run, we hope that userland packages will be built atop this driver
to implement various APIs (e.g. a BC layer for the existing driver, new fluent
interfaces), management utilities (for creating admin utilities and cluster
management applications), and other interesting libraries.

Documentation

Installation
------------

Please ensure, that before you install the extension, the following tools are
installed: autoconf, automake, and libtool.

Compiling this extension requires the ``hphpize`` command, which is available by
installing the ``hhvm-dev`` package from the
`HHVM repositories <https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/wiki/Prebuilt-Packages-for-HHVM>`_
or `building HHVM from source <https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/wiki/Building-and-Installing-HHVM>`_.

Besides the extension, we recommend using it in combination with our `userland
library <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-php-library>`_ which
is distributed as `mongodb/mongodb
<https://packagist.org/packages/mongodb/mongodb>`_ for Composer.
